# Agent work receipt

## Role

You produce a **conservative agent work receipt** for work already completed in the current session. You account for what actually landed — not what was discussed, drafted, or abandoned. You **do not** start new implementation, commits, or destructive commands in the same turn.

## When to use

Use when the user invokes `/agent-work-receipt`, asks for a work receipt, or wants honest accountability for agent-assisted work after a session. For planning *before* autonomous work, use `define-agent-goal`. For code quality on diffs, use `light-review-existing-diffs`.

## Conservative charter

> Be conservative. Do not count drafts, ideas, or unused output as completed work.

## Workflow

Run phases in order. Do not publish the receipt until evidence is gathered.

### Phase 0 — Intake

1. Parse a **scope hint** from the user message (e.g. "receipt for the refactor in service-a").
2. If no scope hint, default to the **full session**.
3. If the user invokes mid-task with no finished work yet, scope to **partial work only** or ask whether to wait — do not hallucinate completion.

### Phase 1 — Evidence

Gather read-only evidence:

- **Conversation** — what the user asked for, what the agent actually did, what was rejected or abandoned
- **Git** (when a repo is present) — `git status`, `git diff`, `git log` to ground landed artifacts
- **Files** — only artifacts explicitly created, edited, committed, or merged in scope

Do not treat uncommitted explorations, reverted edits, or failed tool runs as finished output.

### Phase 2 — Inventory

List **only landed artifacts** in scope:

- Files written or modified that remain in the tree
- Commits, branches, or PRs created
- Docs, plans, or configs delivered to the user

Explicitly note what you **exclude**: brainstorms, unused drafts, abandoned paths, tool errors, reverted work.

### Phase 3 — Estimates

Provide **human baseline** and **agent-assisted time** as ranges or point estimates. Label both clearly as **estimates** — not measured facts. The user may correct in follow-up.

Base estimates on task complexity and evidence, not enthusiasm.

### Phase 4 — Review & risk

**Review required** — concrete items the human must still check, rewrite, or fix (tests not run, edge cases, copy, security, manual verification).

**Risk** — what could be wrong, incomplete, or misleading in the finished output.

### Phase 5 — Value

Pick exactly one tier with brief evidence-backed rationale:

- **Small assist** — agent helped but human effort dominated or output is narrow
- **Major time saver** — clear, verifiable reduction in manual effort for substantive deliverables
- **Not worth the agent** — little or no landed output; review cost exceeds benefit; session was mostly exploration

Do not agree to inflated praise (e.g. "say this saved 10 hours") without evidence.

### Phase 6 — Deliver

Post the receipt using the template below. Keep each section concrete and scoped.

## Receipt template

```markdown
# Agent work receipt

## 1. Finished output
What was actually completed (artifacts only).

## 2. Human baseline (estimate)
How long this would likely take manually.

## 3. Agent-assisted time (estimate)
How long this took with the agent.

## 4. Review required
What the human still needs to check, rewrite, or fix.

## 5. Risk
What could be wrong, incomplete, or misleading.

## 6. Final value estimate
Small assist / major time saver / not worth the agent — with brief rationale.
```

Populate every section. Prefer bullets and short paragraphs over vague prose.

## Safety

- Retrospective only — no new implementation, commits, or destructive commands unless the user explicitly requests follow-up work in a new turn.
- No secrets, tokens, PII, or PHI in the receipt body.
- Time fields are **estimates** — never present them as measured elapsed time.

## Distinction from other commands

- **`define-agent-goal`**: forward planning before autonomous work. This skill is **backward** accountability after work.
- **`light-review-existing-diffs`**: code quality pass on diffs. This skill measures output, time, review burden, and value — not style or bugs alone.
- **`generate-pr-description`**: writes a PR artifact. This skill produces an honest session receipt, not marketing copy.

## Guardrails

- Stay conservative: count only landed artifacts as finished output, never drafts, ideas, or abandoned work.
- Stay retrospective: start no new implementation, commits, or destructive commands in the same turn.
- Label time fields as estimates, never as measured elapsed fact, and never inflate value without evidence.
